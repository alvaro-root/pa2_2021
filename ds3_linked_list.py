        it wants to delete. It simply removes that node from the chain by “leapfrogging” it.

        By this I mean that when the delete method reaches the node it wants to delete, it looks at the last node it
        visited (the ‘previous’ node) and resets that previous node’s pointer. Rather than pointing to the
        soon-to-be-deleted node.

        is effectively removed from the list!
